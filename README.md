# bitcoin-learning-board-game

1. You shall learn how bitcoins work technologically, work economically, and work politically.
2. You shall have fun while learning. 
3. You shall not behave like an obnoxious showoff afterwards. 
4. May your hair smell like garlic if you do.

_Bitcoin Learning Board Game_ will work best if we can actually explain 80% of bitcoin's technological algorithms to an average Joe and a plain Jane. To that end the _board_ game will need to have _mobile smartphone_ components to it. 

Imagine a group of 4 to 10 friends sitting around a table. With their phones on them. They play a narrative story game, as part of which their smartphones interact too, and they all learn various bitcoin concepts together.
